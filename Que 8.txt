Statement 1:

The format specifier** **%s** is used, which briefly means, “expect a string value”. In this case, the string “blue” is passed on to %s. **\n** simply means “Go to next line”; get the cursor to beginning of the next line. This is used because the program has multiple outputs which needed to be displayed line by line. 
Therefore, the output will look like this :

```c
The color: blue
```
**Format specifiers can be seen in printf and scanf functions to represent the format/type of input or output data. Percentage mark ( **% )** indicates the beginning of a format specifier. Some commonly used format specifiers : 

- %d - integer
- %f - float
- %s - string

Statement 2:  

The output is : 
```c
First number: 12345
```
'%d' format specifier is used in printf  and scanf functions to accept integers. 

Statement 3:
Here, the “04” is used to indicate the minimum  width the output should have. Take a look at this the output.
 
```c
Second number: 0025
```

To better understand this concept , we can use this :

```c
   1.printf("Second number: %04d\n", 25);
   2.printf("Second number: %03d\n", 25);
   3.printf("Second number: %02d\n", 25);
   4.printf("Second number: %01d\n", 25);
   5.printf("Second number: %d\n", 25);
```

Output : 
Second number: 0025
Second number: 025
Second number: 25
Second number: 25
Second number: 25

On the first line, the output will be 0025 . %04d indicates that the minimum width should be 4; Since there’re already 2 digits on the integer “25” , other two digits will be occupied with 0 s. 
Take the second line, output will be 025  ; min width = 3 digits , so one 0 will be added.
On the third line, there’s already two digits on “25”, which fulfills the minimum requirement of 2 digits. Therefore, no extra 0s will be added.
4th line, “25” exceeds the minimum requirement of 1 digit ( %01d ) . Therefore, no 0 s will be added. Same goes for 5th line also.

Statement 4: 
%i acts similar to %d except, %i can handle octal and hexadecimal inputs as well. 

```c
Third number: 1234
```

Statement 5: 
Here , **%3.2f** 

- 3 - Indicates the total width. (Excluding the space used for decimal point )
- 2 - Indicates the number of decimal places.

Therefore, the output is for the code is 

```c
Float number: 3.14
```

Statements 6. / 7. / 8. 

```c
//6. %x is used for printing hexadecimal values
Hexadecimal: ff //ff is hexadecimal representation of 255.

//7. %o is used for octal outputs
Octal: 377 //377 is the octal value of 255.

/*8. %u is used for printing unsigned values. Unsigned values are values that aren't 
negative */
Unsigned value: 150
```

Statement 9 : 
**%%** is the escape sequence** which is used to dislpay a singal percentage character (**%**).

      Therefore, the output is

```c
Just print the percentage sign %
```

As you know, the % is used to indicate the beginning of a format specifier. But here, in order to get a percentage sign as output, two adjacent percentage signs (%%) should be used. 

Moreover, number 10 will not be displayed because there’s no format specifier that accepts the value 10. To display the number 10, you should add %d format specifier like this, along with the two other percentage marks ( %% ) .

```c
printf("Just print the percentage sign %%%d\n", 10);
//output
Just print the percentage sign %10
```

** Escape sequences are combination of character/characters used to represent actions which cannot be easily displayed directly. Some commonly used escape sequences are : 

- \n - gets the cursor to beginning of the next line.
- \t - inserts a horizontal tab space.
- \a - used to get an audio alert aling with the output.

backslash ( \ ), marks the beginning of an escape sequence.
